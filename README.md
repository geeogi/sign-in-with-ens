# Sign-in-with-ENS

Enter your ENS. 
Your address will be retrieved from the ENS registry. 
Click sign-in. 
Sign a message using MetaMask which proves that you own the private keys to the address resolved by the ENS name. 

Could be used to build a web3 login flow where users log-in to your site using their web3 Ethereum keys + wallet provider (e.g. MetaMask). 

TODO: enable signing to take place outside of the webpage e.g. using mobile.
